# Insertion Sort
Treats the input as two parts, sorted and unsorted.  Repeatedly inserts the next value from the unsorted part.  
Index starts at 1, assumes index 0 is sorted, and compares index 1 to index 1-1.
Each new element is compared to the previous elements in the sorted list and put into position.
